# z/OS Open Tools FAQ

## What is z/OS Open Tools?
The z/OS Open Tools initiative was started to help modernize z/OS and encourage open source development on z/OS. Currently, we have over 70+ projects that we, along with the community, are porting to z/OS. This list includes Git, Bash, Make, Ninja, CMake, Vim, and many others. All z/OS Open Tools projects are hosted under the z/OS Open Tools organization.
